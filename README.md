**Abstract**

The `human` data was explored with a focus on finding the relationship between gender imbalance and human development index (HDI). Four research questions were subsequently raised and check by statistical analysis with R codes. Linear regression, model validation, logistic regression, categorizing and clustering of the data were explored in the project. The results suggested that gender imbalance issues are more severe in underdeveloped and developing countries with lower HDI. And that using HDI, the teen birth rate would be quite accurately predicted.
